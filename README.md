![Alt text](THEME_HOTEL_SIGN_FIVE_STARS_FACADE_BUILDING_GettyImages-1320779330-3.jpg)


### Description:

    This project aims to analyze hotel booking data to identify patterns and factors influencing customer booking decisions.

    By examining booking behavior, cancellations, and customer requests
    
    we hope to uncover insights that can inform hotel management strategies for optimizing occupancy and customer satisfaction.

### Objectives:

- **Data Cleaning :**


    Handle missing values and identify outliers to prepare the dataset for analysis

- **Data Visualization :**


    Create visualizations to explore key trends and patterns in booking data
    
    focusing on factors that may influence booking decisions

- **Encoding and Normalization :**


    Prepare categorical and numerical data for future predictive models or further analyses

----

### Dataset Overview:

    The dataset includes booking information for both city hotels and resort hotels

 covering details such as :

- **`booking dates`**
- **`hotel type`**
- **`cancellation status`**
- **`number of guests and customer requests`**


    This information provides a basis for analyzing booking patterns and customer preferences.

### Analysis Steps:

1. **Data Cleaning :**

 Handle missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.

2. **Data Visualization :**

 Create visualizations to explore booking trends and patterns.

3. **Encoding :**

 Transform categorical data into a format suitable for analysis.

4. **Normalization :**

 Scale numerical features to standardize data for further analysis.

### Required Libraries:

- **pandas :** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib :** visualization
- **seaborn :** For data visualization to explore booking trends.
- **sklearn :** For encoding and normalization of features if needed.

# **Final Documentation of Data Processing**

After completing the data processing steps, it has been confirmed that the dataset is now ready for modeling purposes.

**Completed Steps :**

1. **Data Verification :**
   - The columns in the dataset were reviewed to ensure there are no non-numeric or anomalous values.
   - Textual columns were encoded, making all values numeric.

2. **Scaling :**
   - **Z-Score Scaling** was applied to all numerical columns.
   - The results showed a balanced distribution with both negative and positive values, indicating that all features are now on the same scale.

3. **Verification Results :**
   - All values were verified to fall within an appropriate range, and no columns contain anomalous or illogical values.
   - Our data is now clean and logical, facilitating future analyses.

**Conclusion :**

After performing all necessary steps, the dataset is prepared for the next phase, which is **modeling**.

We are confident that this data will contribute to achieving accurate and reliable results in future analyses.
